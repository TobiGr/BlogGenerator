In December, the annual [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/2017/08/09/34c3-presale/) will take place. This is the 34th time hackers from all around the world meet and attend the largest hacker convention in Europe.

Like last year Christian Schabesberger, initial author and primary maintainer of NewPipe and the projects related to it, prepared a talk to inform you about what NewPipe is, how it is developed, and how *you* can participate in the development. This time, we hope that there will be a camera so that a video of the talk can be shot. But be assured, in case there is no such camera, we'll try to record it ourselves.

So, if you happen to attend the 34C3 event, make sure to visit the talk during the first conference day (December 27, 2017), 2 pm, room tba.

Feel free to leave some ideas for the talk in the comments!
